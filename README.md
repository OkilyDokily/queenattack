| Spec                                                                                                            | Input                       | Output |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------|
| create a queen object with a constructor that points to an x y position on the board                            | new Queen(x,y)              |        |
| create a method on the queen that determines if a position can be taken by the queen                            | --------------------------- | -----  |
| determine if a piece is in the same row as a queen. - check equality of y values                                |                             |        |
| determine if a piece is in the same column as a queen - check equality of x values                              |                             |        |
| if the piece is not in a row or a column it is diagonal.                                                        | --------------------------- | ------ |
| If the absolute value of difference between the column and queen is the same as between row and queen then true | 4, -4                       | true   |
